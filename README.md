# The Spot App
# Client Side
# Front-End Prod branch

This branch is not to be updated or pushed or pull requested to. This is __ONLY__ for production ready front-end code. Push all front-end changes to _front-end-dev_ branch.

# Full Prod App

Setup will change as we go so I don't feel like adding shit now.
This is for the full app with client and server sides merged.
