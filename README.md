# The Spot App
# Client Side
# Front-End Prod branch

This branch is not to be updated or pushed or pull requested to. This is __ONLY__ for production ready front-end code. Push all front-end changes to _front-end-dev_ branch.

## Dev Setup
Setting up the dev environment is aids because it is react, but since most of it is done, all you have to do is a few steps!

1. npm/yarn Install
2. npm/yarn Install --dev (you might not have to do this idk)

That is all, now on to.. drumroll please...

## Running Dev environment
Now running the dev environment is super simple since this is just the client side.

1. npm/yarn start

Boom done, now locate your browser to http://localhost:3000 and you are golden and live.

## Contributing Guidelines
__NEVER__ contribute to either the __FrontEnd__ or __BackEnd__ branch, only commit to the branches with _-dev_ suffix.

1. Fork the repo
2. Match your branches
3. Make changes to your branch
